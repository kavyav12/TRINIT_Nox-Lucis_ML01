## Road Damage Detection with Faster R-CNN Documentation

### 1. Project Overview
Road Damage Detection with Faster R-CNN is a project aimed at developing an efficient and accurate solution for identifying road damage in images using the Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) architecture. The project leverages PyTorch and torchvision to implement and train the object detection model.

### 2. Installation and Setup
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
1. Install Python 3.x from the official website.
2. Install PyTorch and torchvision using pip:
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision
   ```
3. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kavyav12/Road_damage.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the project directory and install additional dependencies:
   ```
   cd road_damage(2)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 3. Data Preparation
Prepare the road damage dataset for training the Faster R-CNN model:
- Organize the dataset into train and validation sets.
- Ensure that the dataset includes annotations specifying bounding box coordinates and class labels for road damage instances.
- Annotations provided with the dataset are crucial for training the model and must be appropriately formatted.

### 4. Model Architecture
The Faster R-CNN model architecture consists of a backbone network (e.g., ResNet) for feature extraction, a region proposal network (RPN) for generating region proposals, and a region-based detection network for object classification and bounding box regression.

### 5. Training Process
Train the Faster R-CNN model for road damage detection using the following steps:
- Load the annotated dataset and create data loaders for training and validation.
- Define the loss function, optimizer, and learning rate scheduler.
- Utilize the provided annotations during model training to supervise the learning process and improve detection accuracy.

### 6. Evaluation and Performance Metrics
Evaluate the trained model's performance using precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics. Annotations serve as ground truth labels for assessing the model's detection accuracy and generalization capabilities.

### 7. Inference and Testing
Perform inference using the trained model to detect road damage instances in new images:
- Load the trained model weights.
- Preprocess the input image and perform road damage detection.
- Visualize the detected road damage instances with bounding boxes and class labels.
